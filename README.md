# Project-3_Fraudulent_E-Commerce_Transactions
## Project Overview
Every day across the world, millions of e-commerce transactions take place, and amongst these, fraudulent transactions occur. <br>
The aim of this project is to show relationships and patterns of fraudulent transactions through an interactive, user-friendly interface.
## Ethical Considerations
Our project utilizes synethetic data from Kaggle. However, data collected by customers of e-commerce transactions is a normal occurence. Businesses using data based on the transactions of their customers need to ensure that the privacy of the customers is upheld when processing the data. In the case of our dataset, all the identities of the customers are represented by the transaction and customer IDs, which allows us to capture the data without the threat of customer's identity being compromised. Additionally, the way in which we analyzed our data, we are looking at the big picture when it comes to the data. We analyzed the fraudulent transactions is relation to the types of products, payment methods and transaction amounts. Our analysis does not raise any ethical concerns, as it would allow the user (e-commerce business owner) to identify fraudulent transactions without compromising any confidental information from the customers.
